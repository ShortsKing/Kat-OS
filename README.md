## Kat-OS
![GitHub release (latest by date including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ShortsKing/Kat-OS?include_prereleases&style=for-the-badge)<br>
An operating system for the Katos-Katos.

## Installing
To install, go to our releases pages, and extract the .zip file to an SD card. if you dont have a Pi, your computer is not supported yet. you can put an issue tagged "enhancment" with your computer model as a future support suggestion. i doubt anyone will actually want Kat-OS so far, but go ahead. if you are using linux, you should be able to use the `make` tool to build the operating system. you might get an error concerning `#include <readline/readline.h>`. we havent been able to solve this. if you can, please submit a pull request either with docementation on how to fix the bug for your system, or fixing the bug in the code. Then, you get your operating system to run in CLi mode from boot, and get the `Init` program to run from boot. yeah, we hevent got it to run standalone yet. maybe later!
