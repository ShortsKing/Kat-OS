## Kat-OS
![Version][Screen04] ![USB][NoUSB]<br>
a hopefully eventually operating system for the katos-katos, or rather an ARM program that emulates an operating system for your cat. for contributers, please place appropriate commenting. wether you did so will be decided by who approves your push request.

## File Structure
The file structure for this project looks like this: <br>
&nbsp;.<br>
├── build<br>
├── kernel.ld<br>
├── Makefile<br>
└── source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── main.s  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── ____.s  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── ...  

## Installing on Micro SD Card
installation is done through 2 steps: Building, and Installing

### Building
In lx_terminal enter the project root dircetory and type the following command:
```
make
```

### Installing
Copy `bootcode.bin`, `start.elf`, and `config.txt`. Then, put the compiled kernel.img on the sd card as well.

## What is Happening When the OS is Run?
1. The BMC2835 SOC (specifically, the VideoCore IV GPU in it) loads the stage 1 boot loader from an on-chip ROM
    The stage 1 loader knows how to talk to the SD card controller and read FAT16/FAT32 file systems. It looks for a file called `bootcode.bin` on the first partition of the SD card, and loads it. `bootcode.bin` is the stage 2 boot loader.
2. The stage 2 loader loads `start.elf` from the SD card's first partition. This is the stage 3 boot loader.
3. The stage 3 loader then reads `config.txt` which acts a bit like a BIOS configuration configures the GPU and ARM processor loads `kernel.img` and releases the ARM processor to begin executing it
